# Coffee-Shop-Sales-project
🚀 1. Project Overview:
This is a coffee shop sales project. The data was provided in raw form, and the goal was to extract meaningful insights from the messy dataset.

## Steps Involved:

✅ Cleaned the data using Power Query Editor

✅ Made necessary changes to the dataset

✅ Created custom columns (e.g., Weekdays, Month names)

✅ Built charts and pivot tables (used column and pie charts)

✅ Added two slicers (Months and Weekdays) for dynamic filtering

## 🛠 2. Tools Used:
1.Microsoft Excel – for charts, pivot tables, and extracting insights

2.Power Query Editor (PQ) – primarily for cleaning and transforming data

## 📊 3. Dashboard Highlights (Useful Insights):
✅ Quantity Order based on Hours

✅ Category-wise % Distribution based on Sales

✅ Size Distribution based on Orders

✅ Footfall & Sales across various Store Locations

✅ Top 5 Products based on Sales

...and many more insightful metrics!

## 📚 4. What I Learned:
1.How to use Power Query Editor effectively

2.How to create Measures (to show values without looking at the charts)

3.Additional tips like:

4.Preventing unwanted chart movement

5.Setting up passwords for file security

6.Improving dashboard usability
