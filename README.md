# Coffee-Shop-Sales-project
ðŸš€ 1. Project Overview:
This is a coffee shop sales project. The data was provided in raw form, and the goal was to extract meaningful insights from the messy dataset.

## Steps Involved:

âœ… Cleaned the data using Power Query Editor

âœ… Made necessary changes to the dataset

âœ… Created custom columns (e.g., Weekdays, Month names)

âœ… Built charts and pivot tables (used column and pie charts)

âœ… Added two slicers (Months and Weekdays) for dynamic filtering

## ðŸ›  2. Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel â€“ for charts, pivot tables, and extracting insights

Power Query Editor (PQ) â€“ primarily for cleaning and transforming data

ðŸ“Š 3. Dashboard Highlights (Useful Insights):
âœ… Quantity Order based on Hours

âœ… Category-wise % Distribution based on Sales

âœ… Size Distribution based on Orders

âœ… Footfall & Sales across various Store Locations

âœ… Top 5 Products based on Sales

...and many more insightful metrics!

## ðŸ“š 4. What I Learned:
How to use Power Query Editor effectively

How to create Measures (to show values without looking at the charts)

Additional tips like:

Preventing unwanted chart movement

Setting up passwords for file security

Improving dashboard usability
